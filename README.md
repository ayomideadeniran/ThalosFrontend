# Thalos

Thalos is an escrow orchestration layer built on the [Stellar](https://stellar.org) network.
It connects transparently with the [Trustless Work](https://docs.trustlesswork.com/) protocol to offer programmable agreements and milestone-based payments, simple and secure, designed for end users who need to protect their transactions without dealing with blockchain complexity.

## What is Thalos

Thalos is a platform that lets freelancers, businesses, and everyday users create escrow agreements in minutes. You define milestones, fund the escrow, and funds are released only when both parties agree the work is done. No intermediaries, no trust required -- the Stellar network handles settlement in seconds.

**Key features:**

- Programmable escrow agreements with milestone-based releases
- Wallet-based authentication (no passwords, no accounts to manage)
- Real-time dashboards for personal and business accounts
- Built-in dispute resolution workflows
- Bilingual interface (English / Spanish)

cd ThalosFrontend
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

Or with npm:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Environment variables (optional)

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory. All variables are optional and have working defaults:

```env
# Stellar block explorer base URL (defaults to testnet)
NEXT_PUBLIC_STELLAR_EXPLORER_URL=https://stellar.expert/explorer/testnet/contract/

# Show mock agreements in the UI for development (defaults to true)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOW_MOCKED_AGREEMENTS=true
```

### 4. Run the development server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

The app will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### 5. Build for production

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm start
```

## Wallet Connection

Thalos uses the [Stellar Wallets Kit](https://github.com/nicofunke/stellar-wallets-kit) to provide a unified connection modal. Supported wallets include Freighter, xBull, LOBSTR, Albedo, Rabet, and WalletConnect.

1. Click **Sign In** from the navbar.
2. Select your account type (Personal or Enterprise).
3. Click **Login with Wallet** and choose your wallet from the modal.
4. Approve the connection in your wallet extension.

Your connected address is used for all escrow operations: funding agreements as a payer, or receiving released funds as a payee.

## How Escrows Work

Thalos orchestrates escrow agreements through the [Trustless Work](https://docs.trustlesswork.com/) protocol on Stellar. The platform handles the complexity; you just define the terms.

1. **Create** -- Define an agreement with milestones, amounts, and counterparties.
2. **Fund** -- Lock USDC into the escrow smart contract.
3. **Release** -- Funds are released as each milestone is completed and approved.
4. **Dispute** -- If something goes wrong, the built-in dispute flow protects both parties.

All transactions are signed client-side by your Stellar wallet. Thalos never holds your keys or your funds.

## Authenticated User Contract (AuthUser)

The canonical `AuthUser` type is defined in `lib/auth/types.ts` and is the single source of truth for the authenticated user shape across both server and client.

```ts
type AuthWallet = {
  publicKey: string; // Stellar public key of the custodial wallet
  provider: string;  // wallet origin, e.g. "embedded"
};

type AuthUser = {
  id: string;            // auth_users UUID — never empty
  email: string;         // verified email — never empty
  name: string | null;   // optional display name; null if not provided
  avatarUrl: string | null; // OAuth avatar URL; null for email flows
  wallet: AuthWallet | null; // null if the user has no custodial wallet
};
```

### Field guarantees

| Field | Type | Guarantee |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | `string` | Non-empty UUID; session is rejected if absent |
| `email` | `string` | Non-empty email; session is rejected if absent |
| `name` | `string \| null` | Explicit `null` (never `undefined`) to preserve JSON serialization round-trips |
| `avatarUrl` | `string \| null` | Extracted from `user_metadata.avatar_url` or `picture` in the OAuth flow; `null` for email login and registration |
| `wallet.provider` | `string` | Normalizes the legacy server `type` field to `provider` at the hydration layer |
| `wallet.publicKey` | `string` | Strictly validated as a non-empty string; absent or null keys map to `wallet: null` |

### Normalizer

`normalizeAuthUser(raw: unknown): AuthUser | null` converts any network response or `localStorage` blob into the canonical contract. Returns `null` if `id` or `email` are absent, falsy, or not strings — preventing identity-less sessions from reaching the store. All authentication entry points pass network data through this function before calling `login()`.

### Entry points

| File | Event | Normalized |
|---|---|---|
| `components/sign-in-panel.tsx` | Email login and registration | `normalizeAuthUser(data.user)` |
| `components/social-auth-modal.tsx` | Email login and registration | `normalizeAuthUser(data.user)` |
| `app/auth/callback/success/page.tsx` | OAuth callback (Google) | `normalizeAuthUser(data.user)` |
| `lib/auth-provider.tsx` | Hydration from `localStorage` | `normalizeAuthUser(JSON.parse(...))` |
